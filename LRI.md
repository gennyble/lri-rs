# Anatomy of an LRI
The file is made up of many blocks, usually 10 or 11 but cases of 40 have occurred.

Blocks start with a header and contain some data. There is always a protobuf message within that data, and sometimes stuff like the images themselves.

## Block Header
The header is 32 bytes long. and goes as follows:  
| bytes | type | meaning |
| ----- | -----| ------- |
| 4     | -    | Signature: "LELR" |
| 8     | u64  | block length |
| 8     | u64  | message offset from block start |
| 4     | u32  | message length |
| 1     | u8   | message type, see below |
| 7     | -    | reserved |

*message* to mean the protobuf message

*Message Type*  
0: LightHeader ([proto][lh-proto])  
1: ViewPreferences ([proto][vp-proto])  
2: GPSData ([proto][gps-proto])  

[lh-proto]: /lri-proto/proto/lightheader.proto
[vp-proto]: /lri-proto/proto/view_preferences.proto
[gps-proto]: /lri-proto/proto/gps_data.proto

## highlighting key parts
blocks have messages and that's pretty much all you need to know. you can look at the protobuf definitions and pretty readily build a parser, but there are some things i'd like to mention, too.

### LightHeader
The most important header and frustratingly fractured between multiple blocks.

#### RAW Images
What we're all here for, maybe.

zero or more CameraModule ([proto][module-proto]) are collected in the `modules`. In a CameraModule we see a `sensor_data_surface` of type Surface (see line 33 of the CameraModule proto).

[module-proto]: /lri-proto/proto/camera_module.proto

- `start` might indicate a crop, but has always been (0,0) in my experience.
- `size` gives the width/height of the image.
- `data_offset` is the start of the image from the beginning of the block (meaning: it includes the length of the header).
- `format` indicates how we're meant to interpret the image data. It can be a few different things, but i've only seen RAW_BAYER_JPEG and RAW_PACKED_10BPP.
- `row_stride` gives you the number of bytes per row the image takes up. Multiply this by the width to get the size of the image (except Bayer JPEG; see below)

##### Let's talk about Bayer JPEG.  
We don't currently understand *why* the L16 makes these, just that it does. If it's from a colour sensor, you'll get four half-res JPEG (one for each bayer position). If it's monochrome, you'll get one full-res JPEG. For more information go here: [bayer_jpeg.md](/bayer_jpeg.md).

In either colour-case, the `row_stride` in the `sensor_data_surface` will be 0. You'll have to parse the Bayer JPEG header to get the length of the sensor's image data.

##### that's enough BayerJPEG

Going back to CameraModule, there's some more important data for image interpretation. You'll want the `id` which indicates which camera took the exposure. We can map this to a sensor model later! Grab `sensor_bayer_red_override` while you're at it. It'll help with figuring out what CFA we need to use for debayering.

Back in the LightHeader now we'll go to `hw_info`, type HwInfo ([proto][hwi-proto]), then to `camera` which is a CameraModuleHwInfo (described on line 8 in the HwInfo definition). From this we can associate a CameraID, `id`, with a SensorType, `sensor`. It might be good to note here that there are quite a few SensorType defined, but i've only ever seen AR1335 and it's monochrome variant. Perhaps the others were used in development?

[hwi-proto]: /lri-proto/proto/hw_info.proto

<details>
	<summary><i>note on the above</i></summary>
	<p>
		I'm not sure how necessary it is to make this map. Is it ridiculous to assume that the CameraID are consistent between L16 and they they are the same SensorType? This could very well be hard coded with very little harm.

##### `sensor_bayer_red_override`
As far as I can tell this tells us how to shift the CFA for the specific camera. I don't know why it's different; perhaps it's cropped before writing to disk?

Anyway, the x/y you're given seem to map to where Red should be in the 2x2 array. For example, if you have a BGGR cfa and your override is x=1 y=0, you should end up with GRBG (See the ascii diagram below).
```
BGGR cfa                 GRBG cfa

B G B G                  G R G R
G R G R  -> override ->  B G B G
B G B G     x:1, y:0     G R G R
G R G R                  G B G B
```

#### Colour Data
Oh yeah, this is my favourite part. It makes me so excited.

Oooh I *am* excited, but I am also TIRED so I will GO TO SLEEP:
